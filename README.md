# WASP
A project for using MIT App Inventor 2 or similar to turn a web application into an android app.

# Web Application Shell Program

WASP is a project developed in an MIT App Inventor 2 clone that is designed to convert any properly developed web application into an adroid application (there is a possibility for iOS as well).

For those that don't know MIT AI is a GUI and Block-Based programming tool for designing and developing Android applications. It uses a language based off Scratch and is aimed towards teaching young people to code and get them excited by giving them the ability to make real applications.

Also, since it's open source there are a number of clones, and extensions out there that really make it a much more powerful platform than some may think.

This specific project file though doesn't take advantage of all the cool things you can do with it, which is where it's beauty lies. Instead it's essentially a browser shell with a splash screen and some logic for handling the back button as if a native app. If your web application is properly designed for mobile and is responsive it'll work beautifully with this project.

And what you'll end up with in the end is what appears to be a native android application with very little modification needed to the web app itself.

I'll be providing future details and screenshots regarding each of the blocks and elements, but they should be pretty self explanatory. I just wanted to get this out there to the world for anyone looking to quickly make a web application into a "Native" Android application without a lot of coding.

# How to Use
The provided AIA file can be imported into your App Inventor clone of choice. This one was specifically created using https://kodular.io so I can gaurantee it'll work there, but the components seem universal across the clones I've seen so I don't see why it wouldn't work elsewhere out of the box, or at most with some very minimal component changes. So pick a clone, import the project and go.
